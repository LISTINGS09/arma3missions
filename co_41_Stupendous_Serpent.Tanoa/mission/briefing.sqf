	<br/>As part of the Tanoan Defense Force (TDF), your task is to capture two strategic positions near the main Tanoa Airport currently occupied by NATO forces. The first target is a Lumber Yard being utilized as a training area for NATO forces. The second target is the town of Lami, which is currently fortified and known to house anti-aircraft (AA) capable units, thus preventing the use of the airport. Securing both locations is crucial for maintaining air superiority and asserting control over the region.
	<br/>
	<br/><font color='#FF7F00'>Lumber Yard</font>
	<br/>Current Status: Occupied by NATO forces for training purposes.
	<br/>Terrain: Dense forest surrounds the Lumber Yard.
	<br/>Threat Level: High. Expect heavy resistance and armoured support.

	<br/>Current Status: Fortified with entrenched NATO forces, including AA units.
	<br/>Terrain: Urban environment with narrow streets and buildings providing cover.
	<br/>Threat Level: Moderate. Expect fortified infantry positions.
