	<br/>A few infantry patrols have been spotted moving around the valley, with light vehicle spotted travelling along the southern road. You will certainly have to fight your way past these threats in order to reach the objective.

	<br/>Following heavy losses in a recent engagement, HQ strongly suspected that CSAT forces are managing to intercept AAF transmissions.
	<br/>
	<br/>A visit by site engineers have confirmed the AAF's suspicions. The enemy forces have constructed a nearby tower capable of receiving and decoding our transmissions.
	<br/>
	<br/>Due to the surrounding mountains an air-strike on the facility is not possible, so your platoon has been hand-picked for the task, you are to move out and destroy the tower immediately.
